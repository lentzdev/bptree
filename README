This is a simple database library with B+Tree indexing functions, implemented in pre-ANSI C++.
The code is from around 1990-1991.

It was written as the back-end database of a messaging system called Pigeon Post[1].
That system as a whole never saw the public light of day, however Xenia Mailer
and Xenia Edit (also published on https://github.com/lentzdev/) were would-be
components as well. So basically it was a new storage format, something that
Xenia Edit would be able to handle through its flexible storage interface layer.

While this code is old, since it's very specific, it's usable.
Happy to take bug reports and pull requests for it, even.
But realistically, it's here for historical archival purposes.
